### 2003 Mini Cooper S Electric Vehicle Conversion  <a name="electric vehicle conversion"></a>

>This project began when I first saw Tesla showcasing the model S, at this point I was hooked as a Electric Vehicl'er (EV'er). At this point in the game, I did not know how an EV worked, so I first had to learn how it was differen't (but also where an electric vehicle drew similarties from - like the DCDC converter acting as an altenator) from an internal combustion engine vehicle. From there, seeing how an electic vehicle...
